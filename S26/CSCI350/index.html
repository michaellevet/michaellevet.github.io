				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/1:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>HW4 has been posted. It is due by <u>2/12 at 8 PM.</u></li>
					<li>One of the goals of HW4 is for you all to practice working with a new definition (monotone Boolean functions).</li>
					<li>Your background working with Boolean algebra from Math 207 is sufficient to tackle these problems.</li>
					<li>At this point, you have everything you need to work on HW4.</li>
					<li>As usual, please do not hesitate to reach out (via email, office hours, by appointment, etc.) with any questions about the material.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/27:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>HW3 has been posted. It is due by <u>2/5 at 8 PM.</u></li>
					<li>There will be a quiz over HW2 on 2/5.</li>
					<li>I will be out of town for a conference 2/17-2/22.</li>
					<li>Class on 2/17 will be cancelled. There will be a recording posted instead.</li>
					<li><u>Midterm 1 will be on 2/19, in class.</u> I am grateful to my colleagues who will be proctoring.
					<ul>
						<li>I will follow up at a later date to confirm the contents of Midterm 1. Once I know, I will communicate.</li>
						<li>I have not written Midterm 1, and so do not know how many questions it will be.</li>
						<li>My intent is that you will have all relevant HW and quizzes graded prior to the midterm.</li>
						<li>I will not return to the office until Monday 2/23. I expect to have your midterms graded by the end of the day on Thursday 2/26.</li>
						<li>I will make every effort to have them graded, so that I can return them in class on 2/26. However, I am not able to promise this.</li>
						<li>Midterm grades are due to the university by 2/27 at noon.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/25:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>On Thursday 1/29, we will devote the day to practicing building circuits.</li>
					<li>There will be no Zoom on 1/29.</li>
					<li>There will be exit ticket, mainly to help me get a sense of where folks are standing at the end of the day on 1/29.</li>
					<li>The exit ticket will count towards your Unit 1 Quiz Average, but it will be graded for thoughtfulness as opposed to correctness.</li>
					<li>Please gain access to a circuit simulator (so you can actually <em>test your code</em>, so to speak). 
					<ul>
						<li>Please upload a screenshot of your testing some basic circuit on a simulator (an AND gate, for instance, is fine) to OAKS by <u>1/28 at 11:59 PM.</u></li>
						<li>I am partial to <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">Logisim</a>.</li>
						<li>Students using a Mac have found <a href="logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar">this version</a> to be helpful. You might need to manually
							allow it in privacy.
						</li>
						
						<li>Other alternatives to Logisim are fine. There are many circuit simulators online-- a preliminary Google search should
							turn up results.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/20:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>HW2 is posted. It is <u>due on 1/28 at 8 PM.</u></li>
					<li>There will be a quiz in-class on <u>Tuesday 1/27, over HW1</u>.</li>
					<li>The quiz is open-book and open-note, but no electronics. This will be the default for the semester. 
						Any deviations will be clearly communicated.
					</li>
					<li>I anticipate grading HW1 sometime this weekend. My intent is that you have feedback prior to the quiz.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/19:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>I have posted a worksheet on reading from cache, to the Google Drive.</li>
					<li>This worksheet will functionally be a mix of problems and guided notes.</li>
					<li>Please have this worksheet on-hand (physically or virtually) tomorrow.</li>
					<li>I have also uploaded a unit conversion reference to the Google Drive.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/17:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Your Syllabus Quiz has been graded.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Your grade on the "Grade on Syllabus Quiz" question on Gradescope is the thing that affects your grade in this course.</li>
						<li>The "scores" on your other questions don't impact your grade. So if you received a 0 on one of these other questions, 
							this is a signal to look at the feedback.
						</li>
						
						<li>Gradescope allows me to provide in-line textbox comments, similar to what one might use for a PDF. In order to see these comments,
							you will need to click the link for the specific question on Gradescope.
						</li>
						
						<li>I have left everyone an in-line textbox comment on Problem 7, to serve as an example.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>	
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/15:</strong>
					For Problems 4-5 on HW1, parts (b) and (d) were identical. Please do 4(b), and not 4(d). Similarly, please do 5(b), and not 5(d).
					For clarity, I have uploaded updated files to OAKS.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/14:</strong>
					Based on where we ended class on 1/13, I have extended HW1 to be due on 1/20 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/9:</strong>
				<ul>
					
					<li>HW1 has been posted. It is due on 1/17 at 8 PM. </li>
					
					<li>You should be able to start working on the number base conversion problems today.</li>
					
					<li>I will be holding office hours over Zoom, on Friday 1/16 from 2:15-3:15 PM. This is 
						to ensure that everyone has a reasonable opportunity to seek help ahead of the deadline.
					</li>
					
					<li>As the university is closed on 1/19, I will not be holding office hours that day.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/7:</strong>
					Due to technical issues, it is likely that the document camera will not project on to the board tomorrow (this was the case today).
					If this is the case tomorrow, then I will not be able to provide a Zoom option or post scans of the handwritten notes, as I usually would.
					I am working with IT to get this resolved. 
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/3:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>In order to prepare homework and quizzes, you will need a tool to convert LaTeX source files into PDFs.
					    I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> on my local machine (Windows). <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>
						is an online option; note that Overleaf is an interpreter and will sometimes push past compilation errors (this is not a good thing).
					</li>
					
					<li>Please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/P52htnf2J2hXfKCe6">Day One survey</a>. It is optional, and is intended
						to help me get to know you all and plan the course.
					</li>
					
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz is due on 1/16 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW1 is due on 1/16 at 8 PM.</li>
