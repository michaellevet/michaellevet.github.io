				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/12:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>HW2 grades have been posted. Revisions are due to OAKS by 9/26 at 8 PM. Please complete the specified Next Steps.</li>
					<li>Quizzes 1-2 have been extended until 9/14. Please make sure you take the quiz. It is unlikely that I'll extend future quizzes in this way.</li>
					<li>Quizzes over Linked Lists and Selection Sort will be available from 9/14-9/16 (due 9/16 at 8 PM)</li>
					<li>I highly recommend <a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul&#39;s Notes</a> for a review of precalculus concepts (e.g., logarithms)</li>
					<li>I will be out of town from 9/15-9/21 to present research at a conference. Here are the logistics for next week:
					<ul>
						<li>Class and office hours will be cancelled. I will do my best to be responsive via email, but please plan for slower responses.</li>
						<li>Midterm 1 will run from 9/19 through 9/23 (at 8 PM), as a series of timed remote asynchronous OAKS quizzes (each Midterm question will be its own quiz, timed at 
							45 minutes and scaled for students with disability accommodations). There will be Version 1 Questions, for material over which you have not been previously assessed on a quiz; 
							and Version 2 Questions over material for which you have been assessed.	After Midterm 1 is graded, there will be quizzes at a later date (TBD)
							over the content on the Version 1 Questions. The Version 2 Questions will be used for the purpose of grade replacement (see the syllabus for details on
							Midterm grade replacement).
						</li>
						
						<li>Midterm 1 will cover: arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Bubblesort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quicksort, Mergesort, and Binary Search</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/6:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW3 has been posted. The due date is 9/13 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>In the LinkedListADTTest file, there is a typo in the testRemove() method. The String "7" should appear at index 5, not index 6.
						I have updated the LinkedList_Demo.zip file on OAKS. Thanks to those of you who brought this to my attention!
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/4:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW1 has been graded. Please see the feedback on OAKS; your grade on each problem is in the comment box and not the OAKS gradebook.
						If you received full credit, then I left a comment indicating such and that there was nothing more you needed to do. Otherwise,
						there was a clear Next Steps comment. Please complete the Next Steps and submit your revisions to HW1 Revisions on OAKS by 
						9/18 at 8 PM.
					</li>
					
					<li>There will be two quizzes over ArrayLists, Selection Sort, and Bubblesort that will run asynchronously, opening on 9/7 and closing 
						on 9/9 at 8 PM. Each quiz will be timed at 45 minutes (scaled for students with disabilities). They are open-book, open-note, but 
						<strong>individual efforts</strong>. Be aware that if you start the quiz on 9/9 at 7:30 PM, that OAKS may cut you off at 8 PM. I will
						not accept quizzes via email in this circumstance. Please plan accordingly.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/31:</strong> On HW2, there is an optional problem on Insertion Sort. In light of class being cancelled today,
					you may complete this problem on HW2 or HW3. I was intending to cover Insertion Sort today. Instead, I will cover it on 9/5. HW2 is due on 9/6,
					and I would like for you all to have more than a day to digest Insertion Sort. I have updated the HW2 file on OAKS accordingly.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/30:</strong> While I fully intend to hold office hours tomorrow, that is very dependent on 
					whether I have electricity and internet tomorrow. If you log in to Zoom tomorrow, and I am not there at the usual time, please
					assume either my power or internet has gone out. If this happens, I'll communicate as soon as I'm able. On a similar note, please
					prioritize your own safety during this hurricane. Get to safety, and then ask for an extension if you need one. But please get to
					safety first.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/28:</strong> HW2 on LinkedLists will open on Tuesday 8/29 and is due on 9/6 at 8 PM.
					We will have some time in class on either 8/29 or 8/31 to work on HW2. Working with LinkedLists takes time to digest. Please 
					plan accordingly.
				</li>
			
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/23:</strong> There are many tools to compile LaTeX documents as PDFs. You will 
					need to find one that works for you. I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a>. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>
					is another option. There are others-- I don't have particularly strong feelings; if another option works better for you, please feel free to use that! 
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/22:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Please fill out this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/fGqLf5wYDGBnE8wZ7">Day One Survey</a></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/17:</strong> HW1 is now posted to OAKS. It is due on 9/2 at 8 PM. 
					We will have time in class on 8/22 and possibly 8/24 to work on these problems.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/8:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz will open on 8/21 at 12:01 AM and is due on 9/2 at 8 PM.
						One function this assignment serves is to provide a low-stakes way to get set up with
						LaTeX, as well as to ask questions about using LaTeX. Please note that during quizzes,
						you may wish to include images in the PDF. It is worth figuring out how to do this 
						before you wish to do so in a timed environment.
