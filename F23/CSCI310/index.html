				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/6:</strong> HW1 grades have been released. The cutoff for Demonstrated Proficiency (Full Credit) on 
					HW1 required getting (i) Demonstrated Progress or better on Problem 2, and (ii) Demonstrated Proficiency or better on both Problems 3 and 4.
					For HW1, you may revise Problems 3 and 4, and resubmit them to OAKS by 9/11 at 8 PM for full credit on those problems. 
					For each i \in {3,4}, if it is to your benefit, I will replace your original score on Problem i with that of your revision. I will then
					update your HW1 grade accordingly. Note that you must have submitted HW1 to be eligible for this. <br/>
					
					Please also note that your revisions will likely not be graded quickly. I will get them graded before the first Requizzing Period, but I 
					otherwise make no promises about when I will get to them. Additionally, please do not expect this for future assignments.
					
				</li>	
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/4:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>PS3 is now posted. It is due on 9/13 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>Quiz 1 over Standard 1- Induction, will open on 9/7 and close on 9/9 at 8 PM. You may take it in any 45 minute window (scaled for
						students with disability accommodations) as you wish. Note that if you start on 9/9 at 7:30 PM, OAKS may cut you off right at 8 PM.
						I will not accept the quiz via email in this case. Please plan accordingly.
					</li>
					
					<li>There is a typo on HW2 (Problem 3 in Section 3.2). The question asks about DFS, but part (c) incorrectly references BFS. Instead,
						part (c) should reference DFS. I have uploaded a revised HW2 to OAKS, for clarity.
					</li>
					
					<li>Recall that I will be out of town from 9/15-9/21. As a result, I will be recording lectures this weekend on 9/9 and 9/10
						from 2:30-3:45 both days. I have reserved Harbor Walk West 217, in case folks want to attend in-person, and I'll also have 
						Zoom open (use the usual Zoom room for class). If you would like to ask questions during the lectures, this is the opportunity.
						Nobody is obligated to attend on 9/9 or 9/10, but you are responsible for watching these lectures (either live or recorded).
						
						Note that Harbor Walk West is usually locked. You can either call the security office at 843.953.7390 or they can call 
						Public Safety at 843.953.5609 to radio the guard.
					</li>
				
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/30:</strong> While I fully intend to hold office hours tomorrow, that is very dependent on 
					whether I have electricity and internet tomorrow. If you log in to Zoom tomorrow, and I am not there at the usual time, please
					assume either my power or internet has gone out. If this happens, I'll communicate as soon as I'm able. On a similar note, please
					prioritize your own safety during this hurricane. Get to safety, and then ask for an extension if you need one. But please get to
					safety first.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/26:</strong> I will be out of town from 9/15-9/22 for a conference in Italy. 
					While we will not be meeting those days, I will be recording lectures and posting them. 
					You all are responsible for watching these lectures. With that said, I recognize the value in being able
					to ask questions in real-time. I will be recording these lectures over Zoom on Saturday 9/9 and Sunday 9/10, 2:30-3:45 both days.
					I have requested a classroom for those days, in case anyone wishes to attend in-person. Nobody is obligated
					to attend in-person (provided I can get a room) or via Zoom in real-time, but you are welcome to do so. I'll keep you all updated as I 
					have more details.
					
					Also, office hours will be cancelled the week of 9/18. Please feel very welcome to email me, but please be aware that I may be slower
					to respond than normal.
				</li>
			
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/24:</strong> HW2 is now posted. It is due on 9/6 at 8 PM. We will finish covering the material for HW2,
					hopefully on Tuesday 8/29.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/23:</strong> There are many tools to compile LaTeX documents as PDFs. You will 
					need to find one that works for you. I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a>. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>
					is another option. There are others-- I don't have particularly strong feelings; if another option works better for you, please feel free to use that! 
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/22:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>Please fill out this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/vrzhnLQ8Ssjv1RDr5">Day One Survey</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/5:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz will open on 8/21 at 12:01 AM and is due on 9/2 at 8 PM.
						One function this assignment serves is to provide a low-stakes way to get set up with
						LaTeX, as well as to ask questions about using LaTeX. Please note that during quizzes,
						you may wish to include images in the PDF. It is worth figuring out how to do this 
						before you wish to do so in a timed environment.
					</li>
					
					<li>HW1 will open on 8/22 at 12:45 PM. It is due on 9/2 at 8 PM. This assignment is intended to be 
						doable in a week; the long deadline is intended to accommodate folks who add the class late.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/4:</strong> Website created.</li>
