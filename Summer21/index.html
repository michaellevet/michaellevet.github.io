				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/14:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
					PS2 grades have been posted. The cutoff for a Standard 2 Overall Score of 3 required meeting the following conditions:
					<ul>
						<li>Your Problem 2b score was >= 3.</li>
						<li>You scored at least a 2 on all of Problems 2a, 3, 4, and 5.</li>
						<li>On Problems 2a, 3, 4, and 5, you scored either: three 3's, or two 4's and two 2's.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					
					<li>The Zoom recordings and handwritten lecture notes from today are on Canvas. See Modules -> Week 3.</li>
					<li>PS5 is now available. It is due on Friday 6/18 at 8 PM. For Problem 4, I highly recommend reading over the statements of Theorems 50 and 51 in Section 4.1 of the typed lecture notes. You should not need the proofs themselves, but the theorem statements may be useful.</li>
				
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/13:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>Solutions for PS1 and PS2 are now available.</li>
										
					<li>Quiz 1 over Standard 1 and Quiz 2 over Standard 2 will become available on Wednesday 6/16 at 8 AM. You will have 45 minutes per quiz, and you may take the quiz anytime before Friday 6/18 at 8 PM. I would advise starting before Friday 6/18 at 7:15 PM, as Canvas may lock you out at 8 PM sharp.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/9:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>The Zoom recordings and handwritten notes from today are posted to Canvas (Modules -> Week 2).</li>
					<li>PS4 is posted. It is due on Tuesday 6/15 at 8 PM.</li>
					
					<li>The recitation worksheet for this week is also on Canvas (Modules -> Week 2). The goal of recitation is to gently introduce concepts related to trees; and in particular, minimum-weight spanning trees. We will build on these concepts more next week.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/8:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>PS1 grades are released on Gradescope.</li>
					<li>If you would like, you may revise and resubmit either Problem 3 or Problem 4 from PS1, subject to a few conditions.
					<ul>
						<li>You must have attempted the problem you are revising.</li>
						<li>You must still sign the honor code.</li>
						<li>If you submit revisions for both Problems 3 and 4, we will by default grade Problem 3 and ignore Problem 4.</li>
						<li>Let x \in {3, 4}. If your revised score on Problem x is better than your initial attempt at Problem x, then we will update your original Problem x score with your revised Problem x score. In this case, the Standard 1 Overall score will be updated as necessary.</li>
						<li>To clarify, you may redo the given problem. This is different than submitting a regrade request.</li>
						<li>Revisions are due by Saturday 6/12 at 8 PM to Canvas. See the PS1 Revisions assignment on Canvas.</li>
						<li>If it is helpful in deciding which problem to revise, the cutoff for a Standard 1 Overall Score of 3 was the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Problem 2: Score >= 2, and</li>
							<li>Problem 3: Score >= 3, and</li>
							<li>Problem 4: Score >= 3.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Regardless as to whether revising will change the outcome of your Standard 1 Overall Score, it is a good opportunity to get a second round of feedback, as well as to iron out any issues before the Standard 1 Quiz (which will likely be sometime next week depending on when the PS1 Revisions are graded).</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<li>The Zoom links and handwritten notes today are posted to Canvase (Modules -> Week 2).</li>
					<li>We finished covering Section 3.1 Exchange Arguments, and we got up to Theorem 40 in Section 3.2 Interval Scheduling today. We will cover Theorem 40 and its proof tomorrow.</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/7:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>Problem Set 3 (Covering Dijkstra's Algorithm) is available starting at 1 PM. It is due on Friday 6/11 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					<li>The handwritten notes and Zoom recordings are now posted to Canvas (Modules -> Week 2). OIT mentioned that they had issues with their technology freezing about 20 minutes into the 9:25 AM lecture. It may be possible that the videos from the Lecture Videos tab on Canvas may have issues today. So the Zoom links under modules may be better to view.</li>
					
					<li>I have updated the Engagement Standard (Progress) assignment on Gradescope to only display the Recitation 1 grades. You should be hopefully able to see the feedback. Let me know if this is not the case.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/2:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>We covered Chapters 2.1-2.3 (DFS, BFS, Shortest Paths on Unweighted Graphs) and started Chapter 2.4 (Dijkstra's Algorithm), covering through 2.4.1. We will cover a second example of Dijkstra's Algorithm (Section 2.4.2), the proof of correctness and complexity analysis (2.5) on Monday.</li>

					<li>Problem Set 2 (covering BFS/DFS) is now available. It is due on Wednesday 6/9 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					
					<li>The handwritten lecture notes and Zoom recordings from today have been posted to Canvas.</li>
					
					<li>For recitation this week, there is a recitation worksheet on Canvas (Modules -> Week 1). Please work on this in groups. You are welcome and encouraged to have the typed lecture notes on Canvas open, while you are working the problems.</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/1:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>We covered Chapter 1 (Proof by Induction) through the proof of Proposition 5 in the lecture notes. We will begin with Definition 6
						in the typed lecture notes tomorrow. Definition 6 through Proposition 8 on the typed lectures notes correspond to Problem 4 in HW1.
					</li>
					
					<li>If you get a chance, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/XNGNZ2HbEDDVFYSv8">Day One Survey</a>. This will help me plan for the class.
					</li>
					
					<li>The handwritten lecture notes have been posted to Canvas. See Modules -> Week 1.</li>
					
					<li>I have uploaded the Zoom recordings from today to Canvas (see Modules -> Week 1). Additionally, Classroom Capture should automatically post recordings to Canvas (see the Lecture Videos tabs). I have (hopefully) turned on transcripts for the Zoom recordings.
					I have no idea if one recording will be of higher quality than the other; both are there.
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>5/30:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Problem Set 1 will become available on 6/1 at 1:00 PM. It is due on Friday 6/4 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz will become available on 6/1 at 1:00 PM. It is due on Wednesday 6/9 at 8:00 PM.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/19:</strong> CSCI 3104 will be taught with lectures in a hybrid format, where in-person and online sections meeting simultaneously. Recitations will be taught in a remote synchronous format, to facilitate working problems in groups.
					<ul>
						<li>Students enrolled for in-person lectures are welcome to participate virtually if they prefer. </li>
						<li>Due to COVID restrictions, students enrolled for online lecture sections <strong>may not</strong> attend in person. Similarly, students enrolled for in-person lecture sections may only attend the sections in-person for which they registered (e.g., someone who registered for the 9:25 AM in-person lecture may not attend in-person lecture at 11:20 AM, but is welcome to attend the 11:20 lecture section online.)</li>
						<li>While students are welcome to attend online lectures at the time of their choosing, they must attend recitations for which they are enrolled. Exceptions to this will be made on an individual basis, such as in cases of extenuating circumstances, and must be cleared with the instructor (and not the TAs). </li>
						
						<li>All assignments and assessments will be done asynchronously and turned in online. Office hours will also be held virtually. Students may complete the entire course remotely.</li> 
						
						<li>Lectures will be recorded via Zoom and posted to Canvas. Handwritten lecture notes will also be posted to Canvas.</li>
					</ul>
