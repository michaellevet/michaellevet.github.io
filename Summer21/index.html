				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/8:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>PS1 grades are released on Gradescope.</li>
					<li>If you would like, you may revise and resubmit either Problem 3 or Problem 4 from PS1, subject to a few conditions.
					<ul>
						<li>You must have attempted the problem you are revising.</li>
						<li>You must still sign the honor code.</li>
						<li>If you submit revisions for both Problems 3 and 4, we will by default grade Problem 3 and ignore Problem 4.</li>
						<li>Let x \in {3, 4}. If your revised score on Problem x is better than your initial attempt at Problem x, then we will update your original Problem x score with your revised Problem x score. In this case, the Standard 1 Overall score will be updated as necessary.</li>
					</ul>
					
					
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/7:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>Problem Set 3 (Covering Dijkstra's Algorithm) is available starting at 1 PM. It is due on Friday 6/11 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					<li>The handwritten notes and Zoom recordings are now posted to Canvas (Modules -> Week 2). OIT mentioned that they had issues with their technology freezing about 20 minutes into the 9:25 AM lecture. It may be possible that the videos from the Lecture Videos tab on Canvas may have issues today. So the Zoom links under modules may be better to view.</li>
					
					<li>I have updated the Engagement Standard (Progress) assignment on Gradescope to only display the Recitation 1 grades. You should be hopefully able to see the feedback. Let me know if this is not the case.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/2:</strong>				
				<ul>
					<li>We covered Chapters 2.1-2.3 (DFS, BFS, Shortest Paths on Unweighted Graphs) and started Chapter 2.4 (Dijkstra's Algorithm), covering through 2.4.1. We will cover a second example of Dijkstra's Algorithm (Section 2.4.2), the proof of correctness and complexity analysis (2.5) on Monday.</li>

					<li>Problem Set 2 (covering BFS/DFS) is now available. It is due on Wednesday 6/9 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					
					<li>The handwritten lecture notes and Zoom recordings from today have been posted to Canvas.</li>
					
					<li>For recitation this week, there is a recitation worksheet on Canvas (Modules -> Week 1). Please work on this in groups. You are welcome and encouraged to have the typed lecture notes on Canvas open, while you are working the problems.</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/1:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>We covered Chapter 1 (Proof by Induction) through the proof of Proposition 5 in the lecture notes. We will begin with Definition 6
						in the typed lecture notes tomorrow. Definition 6 through Proposition 8 on the typed lectures notes correspond to Problem 4 in HW1.
					</li>
					
					<li>If you get a chance, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/XNGNZ2HbEDDVFYSv8">Day One Survey</a>. This will help me plan for the class.
					</li>
					
					<li>The handwritten lecture notes have been posted to Canvas. See Modules -> Week 1.</li>
					
					<li>I have uploaded the Zoom recordings from today to Canvas (see Modules -> Week 1). Additionally, Classroom Capture should automatically post recordings to Canvas (see the Lecture Videos tabs). I have (hopefully) turned on transcripts for the Zoom recordings.
					I have no idea if one recording will be of higher quality than the other; both are there.
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>5/30:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Problem Set 1 will become available on 6/1 at 1:00 PM. It is due on Friday 6/4 at 8:00 PM.</li>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz will become available on 6/1 at 1:00 PM. It is due on Wednesday 6/9 at 8:00 PM.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/19:</strong> CSCI 3104 will be taught with lectures in a hybrid format, where in-person and online sections meeting simultaneously. Recitations will be taught in a remote synchronous format, to facilitate working problems in groups.
					<ul>
						<li>Students enrolled for in-person lectures are welcome to participate virtually if they prefer. </li>
						<li>Due to COVID restrictions, students enrolled for online lecture sections <strong>may not</strong> attend in person. Similarly, students enrolled for in-person lecture sections may only attend the sections in-person for which they registered (e.g., someone who registered for the 9:25 AM in-person lecture may not attend in-person lecture at 11:20 AM, but is welcome to attend the 11:20 lecture section online.)</li>
						<li>While students are welcome to attend online lectures at the time of their choosing, they must attend recitations for which they are enrolled. Exceptions to this will be made on an individual basis, such as in cases of extenuating circumstances, and must be cleared with the instructor (and not the TAs). </li>
						
						<li>All assignments and assessments will be done asynchronously and turned in online. Office hours will also be held virtually. Students may complete the entire course remotely.</li> 
						
						<li>Lectures will be recorded via Zoom and posted to Canvas. Handwritten lecture notes will also be posted to Canvas.</li>
