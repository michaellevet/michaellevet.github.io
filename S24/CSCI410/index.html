					<li>HW5 is now posted. It is due on 2/16 at 11:59 PM.</li>
					<li>Midterm 1 will run from 2/25 through 3/2 at 11:59 PM. It will consist of a series of OAKS quizzes; that is,
						each question will be its own OAKS quiz (similar in format to the weekly quizzes). Midterm 1 will cover through
						HW5.

				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/17:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>
					PS1 has been graded. Revisions are due on 2/1 at 11:59 PM. For each problem that you revise, please include 
					reasonably detailed reflections addressing gaps in your understanding and how you addressed them. These do not 
					have to be long, but they should be clear, direct, and precise.
					</li>
					
					<li>There will be two quizzes, over Set Equality Proofs and Functions respectively. The quizzes open on 1/19
						and close on 1/26 at 11:59 PM. Quizzes count towards the numerator of your grade, but not the denominator.
						The quizzes are intended to serve as timely feedback ahead of the midterm. So it might be worth taking 
						advantage of these.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/15:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>PS2 will open on 1/16. It is due on 1/23 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>Challenge Problems 1 and 2 have been posted. I recommend completing one challenge problem every 2-3 weeks, but of course
						you are welcome to do them as you see fit.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/10:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>PS1 is now posted. For CSCI 410 students, PS1 adds 8 problems to the denominator, and
					you can earn credit for all 9 problems towards your numerator. For CSIS 616 students, PS1 adds 9 problems to the denominator.
					</li>
					
					<li>In order to prepare homework and quizzes, you will need a tool to convert LaTeX source files into PDFs.
					    I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> on my local machine (Windows). <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>
						is an online option; note that Overleaf is an interpreter and will sometimes push past compilation errors (this is not a good thing).
					</li>
					
					<li>Please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/LJckmM2bTd12vHPr6">Day One survey</a>. It is optional, and is intended
						to help me get to know you all and plan the course.
					</li>

				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>12/12:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>Website created. I am looking forward to proving beautiful theorems with you all next semester!</li>
					<li>The official course text will be my lecture notes (linked above). If you would like a supplemental text, I recommend the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Sipser-- the third edition is the most recent, but the second edition will suffice. In particular, Sipser's text is the standard for similar courses at other institutions.
							It's a very readable book that provides solid intuition.
						</li>
						<li><em>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</em>, First Edition (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Languages-Computation-Addison-Wesley/dp/020102988X">see here</a>).
							The First Edition is targeted towards graduate students and researchers in theoretical computer science, back in the 70's when
							the field was getting off the ground. The second and third editions took out all the good stuff.
						</li>
						
						<li>Savage's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/jsavage/book/">text</a>, specifically Chapters 4-5. Chapters 2-3 would make
							an excellent theoretical course in Digital Logic-- Savage is after the NC hierarchy in these earlier chapters, but does not use this language.
						</li>
							
					</ul>
					
					Be aware that my treatment and notation will differ in minor ways from these books. This is unavoidable at a course of this level.
					</li>
