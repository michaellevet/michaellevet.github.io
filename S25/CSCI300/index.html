						<li>I have explicitly received permission from 4 students to record.</li>

						</li>
						
						<li>I will then shut off Zoom, and let the folks who would prefer not to be recorded, present.</li>
						<li>For each student that presents, you may choose to submit non-trivial, constructive, and respectful
							feedback to OAKS by 2/21 at 8 PM. 
						</li>
						
						<li>Feedback for a single student counts as a single point. So you may earn up to 6 points for feedback.</li>

						<li>There will be an in-class worksheet, which will <strong>not</strong> be graded.</li>
						<li>Instead, please submit a thoughtful reflection about algorithmic bias (2-3 solid paragraphs) to OAKS under Ethics Activity 1 by 2/7 at 8 PM.</li>
						<li>The worksheet might be helpful in reflecting upon the ways in which algorithmic bias can manifest. However, you do not have to 
							limit your scope to the worksheet. You are welcome to explore algorithmic bias more broadly.

					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>On 2/3, we will carve out time for our second ethics activity. The Speaker Series will be in the second part of class.

					</li>
					
					<li>If you plan to participate remotely in the first half of class and attend the Speaker Series in-person, please make an effort
