				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/12:</strong> 
				<ul>
				<li>MT2 has been graded. Your Unit 2 Quiz Average was drawn from Quizzes 5-6 and MT2, and was calculated as the maximum of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Scheme 1: (#Proficiency + #Outstanding)/8.5.</li>
						<li>Scheme 2: (#Proficiency + #Outstanding on MT2)/6.5.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Your Overall Quiz Average is calculated as follows:<br/> [(Unit1 Quiz Average) * 13 + (Unit2 Quiz Average) * 9]/22.</li>
				
				<li>Progress Reports have been posted to OAKS, under Assignments.</li>
				<li>I have taken the ceiling of your HW and Overal Quiz Averages for grade calculations. Note that ceil(87.01) = 88, but ceil(87) = 87.
					This is essentially <em>rounding up at a full point</em>.
				</li>
				
				<li>Several folks benefitted from an additional grade bump after this rounding. Please see Section 3.4 of the Syllabus for details.</li>
				
				<li>As a reminder, initial HW attempt grades are posted to Gradescope. Grades for HW revisions (=corrections and reflections) are recorded as comments on your OAKS submission.</li>
				
				<li>Please carefully check your records against mine. If there are discrepencies, please <u>submit to the Regrade Request Google Form, and not email</u>.</li>
				
				<li>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.</li>
				
				
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/10:</strong> 
					The Final Reflection opens on 4/14 and is due on 4/28 at 8 PM. Please see
					the PDF on the OAKS assignment for details.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/9:</strong> 
					Class tomorrow (4/10) will be cancelled due to Midterm 2.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/5:</strong> 
					HW6 revisions (=corrections and reflections) are due on 4/19 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/25:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>I have unfortunately tested positive for COVID. Therefore, class will be cancelled on 3/27.</li>
					<li>I anticipate/am hoping to return in-person on 4/1 (which is >= 10 days from when my symptoms began).</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/19:</strong> 
					HW6 is now posted. It is due on 4/4 at 8 PM. This will be the last HW assignment this semester.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/15:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>HW5 revisions (=corrections and reflections) are due on 3/31 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>I have posted revised Progress Reports to OAKS. Please check that your records agree with mine.
						If they do not, please use the Regrade Request Google form.
					</li>
					
					<li>We will have quizzes over K-Maps and Regular Languages that open on 3/20 and close on 3/22 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>So you can plan: Midterm 2 will run April 10-12, in the same format as Midterm 1. 
						It will be cumulative, through sequential circuits. There will be 7 questions, and I will grade out of 6.5.
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/22:</strong> 
				<ul>
				<li>The Unit 1 Quiz Average is calculated as follows.
				<ul>
					<li>There have been 13 quizzes, including the Syllabus Quiz, Quizzes 1-4, and the Midterm.</li>
					<li>As the Midterm was graded out of 7.5 quizzes, your denominator is 12.5.</li>
					<li>Scheme 1: (Proficincies + Outstandings on the 13 quizzes)/12.5.</li>
					<li>Scheme 2: (Proficiencies + Outstandings on MT1)/7.5.</li>
					<li>Unit 1 Quiz Average: Maximum of Schemes 1-2.</li>
					<li>So for instance, if Scheme 1 = 76% and Scheme 2 = 93%, then your Unit 1 Quiz Average is 11.625/12.5 = 93%.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Please check that your records agree with mine. If they do not, please use the Regrade Request Google Form.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

					<li>There will be 8 questions.</li>

				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/28:</strong>
					My office hours on February 11 and February 18 will be moved to 3:30-4:30 over Zoom.

					<li>Quiz 3 will cover something related to the addition and majority functions (the latter was covered on the in-class worksheet).</li>

				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/22:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Instead of holding class, I will hold office hours over Zoom from 10:45-11:45 AM. Please use the Office Hours link.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>HW1 Revisions will be due on 2/3 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>The point values on Gradescope do not impact your grade. The labels on the individual rubric items do.
						Please make sure you are looking at the individual rubric items to see whether you obtained Outstanding, 
						Proficiency, Progress, Attempted, or No Attempt.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/16:</strong>
					HW2 is now available. It is due on 1/28 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/11:</strong>
					I will be moving my Tuesday office hours this week to Thursday 1/16 from 4:30-5:30 PM, to ensure
					that you all have a reasonable opportunity to ask about HW1. Please also do not hesitate to reach out with questions
					via email or ask to meet by appointment.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/6:</strong>
				<ul>
					
					<li>Please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/Eojk8oE9Z58pgu1y8">Day One Survey</a></li>
					
					<li>In order to prepare homework and quizzes, you will need a tool to convert LaTeX source files into PDFs.
					    I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> on my local machine (Windows). <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>
						is an online option; note that Overleaf is an interpreter and will sometimes push past compilation errors (this is not a good thing).
					</li>
					
					<li>You will <strong>not</strong> need the textbook on the first day of class.</li>
					
					<li>Please be aware that you are responsible for submitting assignments on time, even if Overleaf is down.</li>
					
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz is due on 1/16 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW1 opens on 1/9 at 1 PM and is due on 1/17 at 8 PM.</li>
					
					<li>You will want access to some circuit simulator (so you can actually <em>test your code</em>, so to speak). 
					<ul>
						<li>I am partial to <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">Logisim</a>.</li>
						<li>Students using a Mac have found <a href="logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar">this version</a> to be helpful. You might need to manually
							allow it in privacy.
						</li>
						
						<li>Other alternatives to Logisim are fine. There are many circuit simulators online-- a preliminary Google search should
							turn up results.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
