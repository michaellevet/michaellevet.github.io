					<li>HW1 has been graded. Your Standard 1 Overall score on Gradescope is your grade on HW1. If you earned a Proficiency or Outstanding, then you have
						checked the box once towards Standard 1. The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 1 Overall was >= (Progress, Proficiency, Proficiency) on (Q2, Q3, Q4) in that order.
					</li>
					
					<li>Please note that the "points" on Gradescope are labels and carry no numeric value. The labels are Outstanding (4), Proficiency (3), Progress (2), Attempted (1), No Attempt (0).
						Gradescope does not let me use letters instead of numbers. So in particular, if your Standard 1 Overall score is a 3, that is full credit and not 75%.
					</li>
					
					<li>You can revise HW1, Problems 2 or 3 for full credit, provided you attempted those problems. If you received a No Attempt on Gradescope for
						either problem, then you cannot revise that problem. Revisions are due on 9/7 at 8 PM. I will have these graded before Requizzing Period 1, 
						but may otherwise be slow to grade them. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, you will not be able to revise HW for credit in this class.
						The purpose of allowing revisions on HW1 is (i) to help you all calibrate to my expectations, and (ii) to encourage you all to review your mistakes
						before the quiz.
					</li>
					
					<li>Quiz 1 over Standard 1 will open September 5 and will close on September 7 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW3 is now posted. It is due on September 6 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW4 is now posted. You can turn in an initial attempt for feedback on September 7 at 8 PM. The final due date will be set once I have
						graded the initial submissions. However, the final due date will be no earlier than September 21 at 8 PM. You can still submit to the final
						due date, even if you do not turn in an initial submission on September 7; in this case, you will not have the benefit of early feedback.
						If you submit by September 7 and you find your grade agreeable, then you can keep that grade and there is nothing more you will need to do.

					Due to unforseen circumstances, I need to change my office hours on Monday to 12-1 PM over Zoom. I apologize for any inconvenience!

				<ul>
					<li>HW1, Problem 3 had a typo with the base cases of the recurrence. I have fixed this and uploaded a revised version to OAKS.</li>
					<li>HW2 is now open. It is due on Monday, September 2 at 8 PM.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

					<li>You should be able to start on the first problem on HW1. We will cover strong induction and structural induction on Thursday,
						which are relevant for the last two problems on HW1. 
					</li>
					
					<li>Regarding LaTeX, I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> as my compiler on my local machine. Many folks are partial to 
						<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, which is a free online service. Because Overleaf is a third-party service,
						it may go out at inopportune times (such as during a quiz or requizzing period). For this reason, I am explicitly refraining from
						recommending Overleaf. You can use it at your own risk. There are many other LaTeX compilers-- you are welcome to use your favorite one.
