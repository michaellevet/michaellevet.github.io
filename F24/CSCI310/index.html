				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>The Withdrawal deadline is 10/25.</strong></li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/29:</strong>
					HW9 opens on 10/1 after class. It will be <strong>due on 10/10 at 8 PM.</strong>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/27:</strong>
				The cutoffs for Proficiency on HW6, Standard 7 were as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Progress or better on Q2, Q3, and Q4, and</li>
					<li>Proficiency or better on at least two of Q2, Q3, and Q4.</li>
				</ul>
			
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/25:</strong>
				There is a minor correction to HW7, Standard 10, Part (d):
				<ul>				
					<li>The original formulation asked to consider a flow augmenting path s-B-E-t.</li>
					<li>This should be s-C-E-t.</li>
				</ul>
				
				I have corrected this and uploaded revised files to OAKS. Many thanks to one of your classmates for bringing this to my attention!
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/20:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><u>HW7</u> is now posted. Recall that it is due on <strong>9/28 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
					<li><u>HW8</u> will become available on 9/24 at 1 PM (after class). Recall that it is due on <strong>10/3 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				</li>	
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/18:</strong> HW5 is now graded. The cutoffs are as follows.
				<ul>
					<li><u>Standard 5 Proficiency:</u> 
					<ul>
						<li>Progress or better on Q2, Q3, and Q4, and either</li>
						<li>Proficiency on all three of Q2, Q3, and Q4, or at least two Outstandings.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><u>Standard 6 Proficiency:</u>

						<li>Proficiency on both Q5 and Q6b, or Progress on Q5 and Outstanding on Q6b.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/14:</strong>
				<ul>
				
					<li><u>HW4 is now graded.</u>
					<ul>
						<li>You can submit your final attempt to OAKS by 9/30 at 8 PM.</li>
						<li>If you like your grade from HW4- Attempt 1, then there is nothing more you need to do.</li>
						<li>Regardless of whether you submitted an initial attempt, you are welcome to submit HW4 by the 9/30 deadline.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Here are some tentative dates moving forward. These are subject to change (with notice), but I wanted to get these to you all so you can
						plan some.
						
					<ul>
						<li><u>HW7 (Standards 10-11)</u> will be <strong>due on 9/28 at 8 PM</strong>. This assignment is quite short.</li> 
						<li><u>Quizzes over Standards 5-6</u> will:
							<ul>
								<li>Open on 9/26, and will</li>
								<li><strong>Close on 9/29 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><u>HW8 (Standard 12)</u> will be <strong>due on 10/3 at 8 PM</strong>.</li>
						<li><u>Quizzes over Standards 7-9</u> will:
						<ul>
							<li>Open on 10/3, and will</li>
							<li><strong>Close on 10/5 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><u>Quizzes over Standards 10-12</u> will:
						<ul>
							<li>Open on 10/10, and will</li> 
							<li><strong>Close on 10/12 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><u>Requizzing Period 1</u> will:
						<ul>
							<li>Open on 10/17, and will</li>
							<li><strong>Close on 10/19 at <u>4 PM</u></strong>, so that I can get everything graded in a timely manner.</li>
							<li>It will consist of 11 quizzes (Standards 1-3 and 5-12).</li>
							<li>Each standard will be its own OAKS quiz (same format as the weekly quizzes).</li>
							<li>If you have demonstrated proficiency twice for Standard X, then you do not need to take Quiz X on the Requizzing Period.</li>
							<li>I will post a progress report prior to Requizzing Period 1, so you know where you stand and what you need to attempt.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
						<li>Please note that the <strong>Withdrawal deadline is 10/25.</strong> It is therefore not possible to push Requizzing Period 1 back any further.</li>
					</ul>
					
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/13:</strong>
					HW6 is now posted. It is due on 9/24 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/7:</strong>
					HW3 has been graded. The cutoff for a Standard 3 Overall Score of Proficiency required obtaining Proficiency or Outstanding on both questions.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/4:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW2 has been graded. The cutoff for a Standard 2 Overall Score of Proficiency required meeting the following conditions: 
					<ul>
						<li>Your Problem 2b score was Proficiency or Outstanding</li>
						<li>You scored Progress or better on all problems</li>
						<li>You scored on Problems 2a, 3, 4, 5: either (i) at least three Proficiencies, or (ii) two Outstandings and two Progress.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Quizzes 2-3 over Standards 2 and 3 will open on 9/12 and close on 9/14 at 8 PM.</li>
					
					<li>HW5 is posted. It is due on 9/17 at 8 PM. This is the first HW with multiple standards. Note that standards-based grading
						incentivizes doing one-standard well, rather than attempting two standards. So I recommend prioritizing Standard 5, and then 
						looking at Standard 6. 
					</li>
						
	
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/31:</strong>
					Correction-- The initial HW4 submission is due on September 11, not September 7. The final due date will be no earlier than September 25 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/29:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW1 has been graded. Your Standard 1 Overall score on Gradescope is your grade on HW1. If you earned a Proficiency or Outstanding, then you have
						checked the box once towards Standard 1. The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 1 Overall was >= (Progress, Proficiency, Proficiency) on (Q2, Q3, Q4) in that order.
					</li>
					
					<li>Please note that the "points" on Gradescope are labels and carry no numeric value. The labels are Outstanding (4), Proficiency (3), Progress (2), Attempted (1), No Attempt (0).
						Gradescope does not let me use letters instead of numbers. So in particular, if your Standard 1 Overall score is a 3, that is full credit and not 75%.
					</li>
					
					<li>You can revise HW1, Problems 3 or 4 (the last two problems) for full credit, provided you attempted those problems. If you received a No Attempt on Gradescope for
						either problem, then you cannot revise that problem. Revisions are due on 9/7 at 8 PM. I will have these graded before Requizzing Period 1, 
						but may otherwise be slow to grade them. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, you will not be able to revise HW for credit in this class.
						The purpose of allowing revisions on HW1 is (i) to help you all calibrate to my expectations, and (ii) to encourage you all to review your mistakes
						before the quiz.
					</li>
					
					<li>Quiz 1 over Standard 1 will open September 5 and will close on September 7 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW3 is now posted. It is due on September 6 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW4 is now posted. You can turn in an initial attempt for feedback on September 7 at 8 PM. The final due date will be set once I have
						graded the initial submissions. However, the final due date will be no earlier than September 21 at 8 PM. You can still submit to the final
						due date, even if you do not turn in an initial submission on September 7; in this case, you will not have the benefit of early feedback.
						If you submit by September 7 and you find your grade agreeable, then you can keep that grade and there is nothing more you will need to do.
					</li>
					
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/24:</strong>
					Due to unforseen circumstances, I need to change my office hours on Monday to 12-1 PM over Zoom. I apologize for any inconvenience!
				</li> 
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/22:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW1, Problem 3 had a typo with the base cases of the recurrence. I have fixed this and uploaded a revised version to OAKS.</li>
					<li>HW2 is now open. It is due on Monday, September 2 at 8 PM.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/20:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>You should be able to start on the first problem on HW1. We will cover strong induction and structural induction on Thursday,
						which are relevant for the last two problems on HW1. 
					</li>
					
					<li>Regarding LaTeX, I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> as my compiler on my local machine. Many folks are partial to 
						<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, which is a free online service. Because Overleaf is a third-party service,
						it may go out at inopportune times (such as during a quiz or requizzing period). For this reason, I am explicitly refraining from
						recommending Overleaf. You can use it at your own risk. There are many other LaTeX compilers-- you are welcome to use your favorite one.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/18:</strong> Please complete this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/euuw8qArQZggF4Rk6">Day One Survey</a>.</li>
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/13:</strong> The Syllabus Quiz and HW1 are both due on 8/27 at 8 PM.</li>
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>6/26:</strong> Website created.</li>
