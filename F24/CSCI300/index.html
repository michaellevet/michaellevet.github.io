					<li>On Wednesday 10/9, class time will be for you all to work on revising your resumes. Please consider using this time 
						to ask your classmates for feedback and suggestions. In previous semesters, students have reported that they 
						found having time to talk with their classmates to be useful.
					</li>
					<li>There will be no class on Monday 10/14, as the Career Fair is on Tuesday 10/15.</li>
					<li>We will have student presentations on Wednesday 10/16.</li>

				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/20:</strong>
					Ethics Activity 2 has been graded. Revisions are due by 10/4 at 8 PM, to OAKS.

					<li>On Monday 9/16, Profs. Lovellette and Hashemi will be speaking to us about the graduate program. This will be a hybrid talk, 
						and I will be recording. If you are interested in the MS CS or MS Data Science programs, it might be worth attending in person
						so that you can talk to them.
					</li>
					
					<li>On Wednesday 9/18, we will have three presentations from your classmates. I have created a Presentations assignment on OAKS.
						Please upload your slides by 3:45 PM the day you present. This is to ensure that I can pull them up on the classroom computer.
						The OAKS assignment lists a deadline of 12/6, but this is to ensure that everyone will be able to submit their slides to the same place.
						Again, please make sure to upload your slides by 3:45 PM the day you present, and <strong>not</strong> 12/6.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/12:</strong>
					Ethics Activity 1 is now graded. If you did not receive credit, you can submit revisions to OAKS by 9/26 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/9:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Please submit your question for Jim Allison or ethics article summary to the corresponding assignment on OAKS. This is 
						due by 9/13 at 8 PM.
					</li>
					
					<li>On Wednesday 9/11, we will have time to work in-class on our third ethics activity. This is ultimately due on October 18 at 
						8 PM. However, the assignment is relatively short and should not require that much time.
					</li>
				
					<li>As of 10:30 PM, presentation slots are now set. Please check OAKS - Content - Week 4. 
						If your slot on the Excel spreadsheet disagrees with your slot on Calendly, please email me ASAP. If you did not sign up on Calendly, then I have assigned you a slot and emailed you. Please refer to the announcement from 8/16 below.
						Due to the size of the class, I cannot accommodate rescheduling for discretionary reasons. Only requests due to extenuating circumstances (illness, emergency situations, etc.) will be accommodated.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/7:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>On Monday 9/9, we will have Jim Allison from Career Services speaking to us. This is a good opportunity to ask
						questions about your resume, applying for jobs, etc. Plan for this talk to be in-person only. If you cannot attend class,
						there is an alternative assignment-- please see the syllabus for details. 
					</li>
					
					<li>Please make sure to sign up for a presentation slot by 9/9 at 8 PM. I will assign slots after that. Presentation slots

				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/1:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Please send your CV to me via email by September 30 at 8 PM. The email should be professional, and this counts as your professional
						email-- see the syllabus for more details.
					</li>
					
					<li>On Monday 9/2, we will discuss the Stable Marriage Problem. A reflection is due on 9/9 at 8 PM to OAKS. There are more details for 
						what you will need to turn in on the OAKS assignment Ethics Activity 1: Algorithmic Bias.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						On Wednesday 9/4, we will use class time for you all to work on digesting sources for your term paper. Please bring two sources to class,
						and be prepared to discuss them with a small group of your peers. For each source you bring, please summarize it, discuss the legal/societal/ethical
						issues present, and discuss any proposed solutions. Then, please summarize one of your classmate's sources. There are no length requirements,
						but your writing should constitute a good-faith effort and demonstrate clear understanding. Avoid <em>fluff</em> writing to fill space without saying anything. This writeup
						is due on 9/13 at 8 PM. <br/>
						
						The goal of this is to provide scaffolding for your presentation and term paper. Taking the time to explain things to others will help you 
						organize your thoughts. Ask questions of your classmates. Please also make the extra effort to be respectful. Folks may choose to explore topics
						that are sensitive or deeply personal in nature.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/24:</strong>

						welcome new students to the department, learn more about student clubs, talk to faculty about research opportunities, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/18:</strong>

					</li>
					<li>Please fill out this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/1Xc4EELrWEzmT514A">Day One Survey</a></li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/16:</strong> There will be presentations throughout the course. You will select a topic from a list on OAKS,
