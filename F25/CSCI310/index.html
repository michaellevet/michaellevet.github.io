			<p>			
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/14:</strong>  
				I have made some effort to schedule ahead. Here is the tentative game plan.
				<ul>
				<li>Class on 10/16 will be cancelled for RQ1.</li>
				
				<li><u>Homework:</u> I have optimized the deadlines for maximum flexibility, but be aware that the deadlines start to stack
					at the end of the semester. Do start early and plan accordingly.
					<ul>
						<li><u>HW9:</u> is now open, and is <u>due on 10/27 at 9 PM.</u></li>
						<li><u>HW10:</u> opens on 10/21, and is <u>due on 11/3 at 9 PM.</u></li>
						<li><u>HW11:</u> This is Standard 23, the Dynamic Programming project.
						<ul>
							<li>The logistics are similar to Standard 4.</li>
							<li>There will be two scheduled attempts.</li>
							<li>Attempt 1 will open on 10/21 and is <u>due on 11/25 at 9 PM.</u></li>
							<li>Attempt 2 is <u>due on 12/7 at 9 PM.</u></li>
							<li>If you like your grade on Attempt 1, then you do <strong>not</strong> need to submit for Attempt 2.</li>
							<li>If you do not like your grade on Attempt 1 or if you did not submit to Attempt 1, then you may submit to Attempt 2.</li>
						</ul>	
						</li>
						
						<li><u>HW12:</u> will likely open on 10/30 or 11/4 (depending on the pace of class). It is <u>due on 11/10 at 9 PM.</u></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				
				<li><u>Quizzes:</u> I have made some effort to keep it to 3 quizzes per weekend.
				<ul>
					<li><u>Standards 12-14:</u> Opens 10/23 and is due on 10/25 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li><u>Standards 15-17:</u> Opens 10/30 and is due on 11/1 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li><u>Standards 18-20:</u> Opens 11/6 and is due on 11/8 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li><u>Standards 21-22, 24:</u> Opens 11/20 and is due on 11/25 at 9 PM. This is to provide some flexibility 
							to manage your work with other classes, leading up to Thanksgiving.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><u>Requizzing Period 2 (RQ2):</u>
				<ul>
					<li>This will open on 11/13 and will close on 11/15 at 4 PM.</li>
					<li>Class will be cancelled on 11/13.</li>
					<li>RQ2 will cover Standards 13-22 and 24.</li>
					<li>This will be your third attempt at Standards 13-20, and your second attempt at Standards 21-22, 24.</li>
					<li>Your third attempt at Standards 21-22, 24 will be the week following RQ2.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/12:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li>Progress reports are now posted. Please check your records against mine.</li>
					<li>If something is incorrect, please submit to the <strong>Regrade Request Google Form</strong> and <strong>not</strong> email.</li>
					<li>As usual, I reserve the right to update my records-- positively or negatively-- if I find that I have recorded something incorrectly.</li>
					<li>For Standard 0 (Syllabus Quiz) and Standard 4, you need to demonstrate proficiency once to earn credit towards your final grade.</li>
					<li>For the remaining standards on this progress report, you need to demonstrate proficiency twice to earn credit towards your final grade.</li>
					<li>While all standards count equally, you all have likely now realized that they are not all of equal difficulty.</li>
					<li>Standards 2-3, 5, 7-11 are amongst the easier standards in the class, marked accordingly with a (*) on the Syllabus.</li>
					<li>Standards 1, 6, and 12 are more challenging standards.</li>
					<li>As you prepare for Requizzing Period 1 (RQ1), I recommend being strategic-- prioritize the easier standards first.</li>
					<li>Once you have credit for a standard towards your final grade, there is no need to attempt it again.</li>
					<li>So for instance, if your progress report reads <u>Standard 3: 2</u>, then you have full credit on Standard 3 and do <strong>not</strong>
						need to attempt it on RQ1.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/10:</strong>  
					HW7 grades are now posted. The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 12 required (i) >= Progress on all problems, 
					and (ii) >= Proficiency on at least three problems.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/8:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li>Due to the King Tide and potential of flooding tomorrow, I will be cancelling class. Instead, there will be a recorded video
					lecture to watch. I will update you all when this video is online. Stay safe and dry.
					</li>
					
					<li>Update: the video and handwritten notes are now online.</li>
					<li>My office hours over Fall break will be Monday and Tuesday, 10-11 AM over Zoom.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/29:</strong>  
				I am required to submit Midterm Grades to the university between 10/2-10/8. More information below:
				<ul>
					<li>There have been two attempts at Standards 1-3, 5-6, and one attempt at Standards 4, 7-9.</li>
					<li>Standard 0 is the Syllabus Quiz.</li>
					<li>I have based Midterm Grades on #Standards where you have demonstrated proficiency at least once.</li>
					<li>Historically, the first quartile cutoff has been a good gauge of whether folks are on track for a C- or better.</li>
					<li>We have:
					<ul>
						<li>First Quartile: 6.25 standards</li>
						<li>Median: 7 standards</li>
						<li>Average: 7.18 standards</li>
						<li>Third Quartile: 8 standards</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>I will thus be issuing Midterm Grades as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>A: 9-10 standards</li>
						<li>B: 7-8 standards</li>
						<li>C: 6 standards</li>
						<li>C-: 5 standards</li>
						<li>D: 4 standards</li>
						<li>F: 0-3 standards</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>I have posted <strong>Progress Reports</strong> to Gradescope. Please compare your records against mine.</li>
					<li>If my records do not match yours, please submit to the <strong>Regrade Request Google form</strong> and <strong>not email</strong>.</li>
					<li>I reserve the right to correct my records, positively or negatively, if I find I have made a mistake.</li>
					<li>Your Midterm Grade has been posted to OAKS.</li>
					<li>Requizzing Period 1 will be graded before the drop deadline of 10/24.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/27:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li>HW5 has been graded. The Proficiency cutoff for Standard 7 required (i) Progress or better on all problems, and (ii) Proficiency or better on at least two problems.</li>
					<li>HW8 has been posted.
					<ul>
						<li>Recall that it is <strong>due on 10/15 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li>For this assignment, extensions will be reserved for emergency situations only.</li>
						<li>Please read Page 3 of the HW8 PDF file carefully. It will likely answer many of your questions (e.g., how to format your answers).</li>
						<li>Recall that mathematical expressions and equations <strong>must</strong> be typed on HW.</li>
						<li>On a quiz for Standard 13 or Standard 14, you will be given two functions and asked to compare them.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/23:</strong>  
				Per the discussions in class today regarding HW8:
				<ul>
					<li>HW8 will be posted sometime after class on 9/25 (no later than the end of the day on 9/27-- I will email when it is open).</li>
					<li>HW8 will be due on <storng>10/15 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
					<li>I will be holding office hours over Fall break on 10/13 and 10/14 10-11 AM. There will not be office hours on 10/14 from 5:05-6 PM.</li>
					<li>I will be available via email and to meet by appointment over Fall break.</li>
					<li>This is a <strong>long</strong> HW. I expect that you all will plan accordingly.</li>
					<li>As RQ1 opens on Thursday 10/16, extensions will be limited to emergency situations.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/19:</strong>  
				HW4 grades have been posted.
				<ul>
					<li>The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 5 required >= Progress on Problems 2-4, and >= Proficiency on at least two 
					of Problems 2-4.
					</li>
					
					<li>The cutoff for Proficiency for Standard 6 required:
					<ul>
						<li>>= Progress on Problems 5, 6(a), and 6(b).</li>
						<li>Proficiency on both 5 and 6b, OR Outstanding on Problem 5 and Progress on Problem 6(b).</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>As a reminder, Standard 6 is one of the more challenging standards in the course. While all standards count equally,
						they are not all of the same difficulty. The more mechanical standards are marked with a (*) on the Syllabus (see Section 3.2).
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/9:</strong>  
				HW3 grades have been posted.
					<ul>
						<li>The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 3 required scores of >= Proficiency on both Q2 and Q3.</li>
						<li>You may submit Standard 4 by October 1 at 9 PM to OAKS, regardless of whether you attempted Standard 4 initially.</li>
						
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/3:</strong>  
					HW2 grades have been posted. The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 2 required:
					<ul>
						<li>Progress or better on all questions, and</li>
						<li>Proficiency or better on at least 4 out of 5 questions (2a and 2b were treated as separate questions).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/30:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li><u>I will be out of town 9/12-9/19 for a conference.</u> 
					<ul>
						<li>Lectures and handwritten notes for 9/16 and 9/18 have been recorded and posted to OAKS.</li>
						<li>Class and office hours will be cancelled during that time.</li>
						<li>Please do feel very welcome and encouraged to email me, as you normally would. I will 
							do my best to respond in a timely manner. However, please plan for slower response times than usual.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<li>Here are the upcoming <u>HW deadlines</u>:
					<ul>
						<li><u>HW4</u> will open on 9/2 at 5 PM. It will be due on <strong>9/15 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li><u>HW5</u> will open on 9/4 at 5 PM. It will be due on <strong>9/23 at 9 PM.</strong> This is to ensure that you have an opportunity
							to meet with me during office hours before submitting the assignment.
						</li>
						
						<li><u>HW6</u> will open on 9/15, and it will be due on <strong>9/29 at 9 PM.</strong> This assignment is short. If you are spending much more than 
							an hour on a single standard, then you should reach out for help.
						</li>
						
						<li><u>HW7</u> will open on 9/23 at 5 PM. It will be due on <strong>10/6 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Here are the upcoming <u>Quiz deadlines</u>:
					<ul>
						<li><u>Quiz- Standard 2</u> will open on 9/11 and will close on <strong>9/13 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li><u>Quiz- Standard 3</u> will open on 9/18 and will close on <strong>9/20 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li><u>Quizzes- Standards 5, 6</u> will open on 9/25 and will close on <strong>9/27 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li><u>Quizzes- Standards 7-9</u> will open on 10/2 and will close on <strong>10/4 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
						<li><u>Quizzes- Standards 10-11</u> will open on 10/9 and will close on <strong>10/11 at 9 PM.</strong></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Here are details about <u>Requizzing Period 1 (RQ1)</u>.
					<ul>
						<li>It will open on 10/16, and close on <strong>10/18 at 4 PM.</strong></li>
						<li>It will consist of one quiz per standard, for Standards 1-3 and 5-12.</li>
						<li>This will be your third scheduled attempt at Standards 1-3 and 5-11.</li>
						<li>This will be your second scheduled attempt at Standard 12.</li>
						<li>There will be a third scheduled attempt at Standard 12, date TBD.</li>
						<li>If you have demonstrated proficiency twice on a standard already, then you do <strong>not</strong> need
							to attempt it on RQ1. There is no benefit to your grade in doing so.
						</li>
						<li>I will post progress reports reasonably before RQ1, so that you can plan accordingly.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/27:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li>HW1 has been graded. Your Standard 1 Overall score on Gradescope is your grade on HW1. If you earned a Proficiency or Outstanding, then you have
						checked the box once towards Standard 1. The cutoff for Proficiency on Standard 1 Overall was >= (Progress, Proficiency, Proficiency) on (Q2, Q3, Q4) in that order.
					</li>
					
					<li>Please note that the "points" on Gradescope are labels and carry no numeric value. The labels are Outstanding (4), Proficiency (3), Progress (2), Attempted (1), No Attempt (0).
						Gradescope does not let me use letters instead of numbers. So in particular, if your Standard 1 Overall score is a 3, that is full credit and not 75%.
					</li>
				</ul> 
				
				</li>
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/26:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW3 is now posted. It is due on 9/8 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li>For Standard 4, you will be able to (re)submit it at a later date (TBD) after I grade HW3.</li>
					<li>You may submit at that later date, even if you do not attempt Standard 4 by 9/8 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>Recall that Standard 4 will only have two attempts (as outlined above, and on the Syllabus); hence, the revisions.</li>
					<li>You will have three scheduled quizzing opportunities on Standard 3. Therefore, Standard 3 on HW3 is not eligible for revisions.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/20:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW2 will become available on 8/21 at 5 PM. It is due on 9/1 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li>Quiz- Standard 1 will become available on Thursday 9/4, and it will be due on Saturday 9/6 at 9 PM. </li>
	
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/7:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Website created.</li>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz and HW1 are both due on 8/26 at 9 PM.</li>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz will open immediately (as soon as OAKS becomes availaable), and HW1 will open 
						on 8/26 at 5 PM (after the second section ends).
					</li>
					
					<li>Please complete this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/UvaLUTWTYgovSiZD6">Day One Survey</a>.</li>
					
					
					
					<li>Regarding LaTeX, I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> as my compiler on my local machine. Many folks are partial to 
						<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, which is a free online service. Because Overleaf is a third-party service,
						it may go out at inopportune times (such as during a quiz or requizzing period). For this reason, I am explicitly refraining from
						recommending Overleaf. You can use it at your own risk. There are many other LaTeX compilers-- you are welcome to use your favorite one.
