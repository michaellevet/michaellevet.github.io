						</ul>					
					</li>
					
					<li>I have posted Progress Reports to OAKS. Please check this.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>It will be closed-book, closed-note, and an individual effort.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Class and office hours will be cancelled during this time.</li>
							<li>Please do feel very welcome and encouraged to email me, as you normally would. I will do my best to respond in a timely manner. However, please plan for slower response times than usual. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><u>HW3</u> will open on 9/9. <strong>It is due on 9/24 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
					<li>On 9/9, we will discuss Stacks and Queues.</li>

							</li>
							<li>Please submit everything in a ZIP file to OAKS.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
						<li>Please note that the "points" on Gradescope are labels and carry no numeric value. 
						The labels are Outstanding (4), Proficiency (3), Progress (2), Attempted (1), No Attempt (0). 
						Gradescope does not let me use letters instead of numbers. So in particular, if your Standard 1 Overall score is a 3, that is full credit and not 75%. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/3:</strong>

					As a clarification for HW1 and HW2, please do not use the java.util.ArrayList or java.util.LinkedList classes.
					The point of HW1 and HW2 is for you to implement these data structures from scratch, so that you understand how
					they work under the hood.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/26:</strong>
					For 8/28, please bring your computer. There will be in-class programming (ungraded).

					<li>Website created.</li>

					<li>HW1 is due on 9/2 at 8 PM.</li>
					
					
					<li>Please complete this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/zRKt1M1BnWtENLGQ7">Day One Survey</a>.</li>
					
					
					
					<li>Regarding LaTeX, I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> as my compiler on my local machine. Many folks are partial to 
						<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, which is a free online service. Because Overleaf is a third-party service,
						it may go out at inopportune times (such as during a quiz or exam). For this reason, I am explicitly refraining from
						recommending Overleaf. You can use it at your own risk. There are many other LaTeX compilers-- you are welcome to use your favorite one.
