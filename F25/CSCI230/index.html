				<ul>
					<li>HW8 corrections and reflections are due on 12/7 at 11:59 PM.</li>
					<li>I will be holding office hours at the usual times on 12/1 and 12/2.</li>
					<li>My last day of office hours will be 12/2.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/20:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>It was brought to my attention that I uploaded the wrong file for HW9. I have fixed this.</li>
					<li>While I am not permitted to have assignments due on Reading Day, I am permitted to give extensions. 
						So if you would like an extension on HW9, please do request one via the Google Form.
					</li>
					
					<li>MT3 has been graded.
					<ul>
						<li>I will be in my office today shortly after my class ends at 4:50, until 5:30. You are welcome to stop by and pick
							up your exam if you would like.
						</li>
						<li>Class on 11/25 will consist of me handing back exams. There will not be any new material covered.</li>
						<li>Your Overall Quiz Average is: (7.5 * Unit1 + 14 * Unit2 + 12 * Unit3)/33.5.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/19:</strong>
					A minor clarification point regarding HW8-- the hash function should be
					h(x) = x (mod this.prime). Many thanks to those of you that caught this typo!
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/15:</strong>
					HW7 Corrections and Reflections are due by 12/7 at 11:59 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/11:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>We will have a quiz on tree traversals on 11/13.</li>
					<li>We will have a quiz on heaps on 11/18.</li>
					<li>There will be an exam on BSTs, tree traversals, heaps, and hash tables on 11/20.</li>
					<li>For the hash tables, you will only be assessed on linear and quadratic probing.</li>
					<li>The quizzes and exam will be open-book and open-note, but individual efforts.</li>
					<li>Electronic devices will <strong>not</strong> be permitted on the quizzes or exam.</li>
					<li>The goal is to help you all calibrate for this material before the final.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/10:</strong>
				<ul>
				<li>
					Here are some logistics regarding the rest of the semester (modulo, perhaps, some quizzes):
					<ul>	
						<li>HW8 has been posted. It is <u>due on 11/25 at 8 PM.</u></li>
						<li>HW9 has been posted. It is <u>due on 12/1 at 11:59 PM.</u></li>
						<li>Our final exam is 12/4 from 10:30-12:30 in the usual classroom.</li>
						<li>Per university policy, HW cannot be due on 12/2 Reading Day.</li>
						<li>Thus, the due date and time for HW9 is as much flexibility as I am able to provide.</li>
						<li>I am required to submit final grades by 12/10 at noon. Revisions for HW8 and HW9 will therefore
							be <u>due on 12/7 at 11:59 PM</u>.
						</li>
						
						<li>I will attempt to have the final graded and communicate your standing in the class in a timely manner, 
							so that you all can decide whether spending time on revisions makes sense for your situation. 
						</li>
						
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Here are some logistics regarding the <u>Final Exam</u>:
					<ul>
						<li>It will be cumulative.</li>
						<li>It will be open-book and open-note, but an individual effort.</li>
						<li>Electronic devices will <strong>not</strong> be permitted.</li>
						<li>The entire exam will be in-person.</li>
						<li>If it is to your advantage, I will make the following replacements:
						<ul>
							<li>Your entire Quiz Average with your Final Exam score.</li>
							<li>Your HW4 grade with your Final Exam score.</li>
							<li>Your HW5 grade with your Final Exam score.</li>
							<li>Your HW9 grade with your Final Exam score.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
						<li>I will only apply the replacements that benefit you.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/8:</strong> MT2 has been graded.
				<ul>
					<li>There were 8 questions. I graded the exam out of 7.</li>
					<li>For the Quicksort problem, I did the following. If you wrote down a correct recurrence, I added 0.5 to the numerator.
						If you wrote down and correct recurrence and solved it correctly, then I added 1 to the numerator. That is, I treated this as 
						a bonus problem.
					</li>
					
					<li>If your MT2 average was higher than your HW4 grade, then I replaced your HW4 grade with your MT2 grade.</li>
					<li>If your MT2 average was higher than your HW5 grade, then I replaced your HW5 grade with your MT2 grade.</li>
					
					<li>I dropped two additional quizzes. So The denominator for the Unit 2 quizzes is 14.</li>
					<li>Your Overall Quiz Average is [(7.5 * Unit1 Quiz Average) + (14 * Unit2 Quiz Average)]/21.5.</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/6:</strong>
					HW6 has now been graded. Corrections and reflections are due by 11/25 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>11/1:</strong>
					HW7 is now posted. It is due on 11/14 at 8 PM.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/22:</strong>
					HW5 corrections and reflections are due by 11/5 at 8 PM. These should be synergistic with studying for MT2.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/18:</strong>
					As a reminder, we are following the CSCI 310 Course Textbook (linked above) regarding analyzing independent + dependent loops,
					writing down runtime recurrences, the unrolling method, and the tree method. Please make sure to reference this, both for examples
					and to gauge the level of detail that is expected on HW/Quizzes/Exams.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/16:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>The quiz from class today has been graded. There will be another quiz covering the identical topics (Big-O from HW4) on 
						10/23. This will again be in-person.
					</li>
					
					<li>This should give you all ample time to review today's quiz and HW4, as well as to ask any questions.</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/14:</strong> Here is the tentative game plan for the remainder of the semester (modulo some quizzes).
				There is a lot of ground to cover, and it will come quickly. Do plan accordingly.
				I will do my best to provide some class time to work on the programming projects, both so you can ask me for help in real-time and to help mitigate the demands on your time.
				<ul>
					<li><u>HW5</u> is now open. It is <u>due on 10/21 at 8 PM.</u></li>
					<li>There will be an in-class quiz on 10/28 on analyzing nested dependent loops.</li>
					<li>There will be an in-class quiz on 10/30 on writing down recurrences for recursive code.</li>
					<li>There will be remote quizzes on OAKS for the unrolling and tree methods, that will open on 10/30 and close on 11/1 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li><u>Midterm 2</u> will cover HW4-5. It will consist of two parts:
					<ul>
						<li>An in-class exam on 11/6, covering Big-O and analyzing nested loops. I will ask you to state the definition of Big-O verbatim.</li>
						<li>Two remote quizzes that open on 11/6 and close on 11/8 at 8 PM, covering the unrolling and tree methods respectively.</li>
						<li>The in-class exam will be closed-book, closed-note, and an individual effort.</li>
						<li>The remote quizzes will be open-book, open-note, but an individual effort.</li>
						<li>Use of generative AI is strictly prohibited.</li>
						<li>If it is to your advantage, your Midterm 2 grade will replace your Unit 2 Quiz Average (which includes every quiz after Midterm 1).</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><u>HW6 (Binary Search Tree Project)</u> will open on 10/16 and is <u>due on 10/30 at 8 PM</u>.</li>
					<li><u>HW7 (Binary Heap Project)</u> will open (TBD- depending on the pace of class) and is <u>due on 11/13 at 8 PM</u>.</li>
					<li><u>HW8 (Hash Table Project)</u> will open (TBD- depending on the pace of class) and is <u>due on 11/21 at 8 PM</u>.</li>
					<li><u>HW9 (Graph Algorithms-- no programming)</u> will open (TBD- depending on the pace of class) and is <u>due on 12/1 at 8 PM.</u></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/13:</strong>  
					In light of everything going on, I have extended HW3 revisions until 10/14 at 8 PM. I hope this helps!
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/11:</strong>  
					HW4 revisions (corrections and reflections) are due by 10/25 at 8 PM. Unless the Gradescope rubric explicitly states otherwise,
					you are permitted to revise a specific problem.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/8:</strong>  
				<ul>
					<li>Due to the King Tide and potential of flooding tomorrow, I will be cancelling class. Instead, there will be a recorded video
					lecture to watch. I will update you all when this video is online. Stay safe and dry.
					</li>
					
					<li>Update: the video and handwritten notes are now online.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/4:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HW4 has been posted. It is due on 10/10 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>As a reminder, mathematical expressions must be typeset using LaTeX and proper mathematical notation.
						They cannot be handwritten.
					</li>
					
					<li>There will be an in-class quiz on Big-O on 10/16.</li>
					<li>There will be a remote quiz, administered via OAKS, on analyzing independent loops. This quiz
						will open on 10/16 and close on 10/18 at 8 PM.
					</li>
					
					<li>The deadline to withdraw from a course is 10/24.</li>
					<li>The above deadlines are in place, to ensure that I am able to grade a couple additional quizzes before the drop deadline.</li>
				</ul>	
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>10/3:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>MT1 has been graded. There were 6 questions, and I graded out of 4.5.</li>
					<li>MT1 will be returned in class on Tuesday. Please plan to attend in-person on Tuesday (unless you are sick)
						to retreive your exam.
					</li>
					<li>Your <strong>Unit 1 Quiz Average</strong> is more important than your MT1 grade. </li>
					
					<li>Your Unit 1 Quiz Average is the larger of the following two schemes:
						<ul>
							<li><u>Scheme 1:</u> There were 9 quizzes (Syllabus Quiz, Quiz1, Quiz2, and the 6 MT1 questions).
								Your Scheme 1 was calculated as (#Proficiency + #Outstanding)/7.5.
							</li>
							
							<li><u>Scheme 2:</u> Your MT2 grade, as a percentage.</li>
						</ul>					
					</li>
					
					<li>I have posted Progress Reports to OAKS. Please check this.</li>
					<li>If you have concerns about your standing in the course, please do not hesitate to reach out.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/26:</strong>
					FAST Enterprises will be coming to class to speak for a few minutes on 9/30 at the start.
					They are looking to hire for internships and full-time positions. I recommend attending
					in-person if you are able, so that you can ask them questions.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/21:</strong>
					Midterm 1 will be held in-person on October 2.
					<ul>
						<li>It will be closed-book, closed-note, and an individual effort.</li>
						<li>During the exam, please leave your electronics, including but not limited to, phones, smart watches,
							laptops, and tablets, in your backpacks. These should not be on your person or out during the 
							exam.
						</li>
						
						<li>The exam is cumulative through HW3 and Mergesort. It will <strong>not</strong> cover any material introduced
							on 9/24 or later.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/10:</strong>

				<ul>
					<li><u>I will be out of town for a conference from 9/12-9/19.</u>
						<ul>
							<li>Class and office hours will be cancelled during this time.</li>
							<li>Please do feel very welcome and encouraged to email me, as you normally would. I will do my best to respond in a timely manner. However, please plan for slower response times than usual. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><u>HW3</u> will open on 9/9. <strong>It is due on 9/24 at 8 PM.</strong></li>
					<li>On 9/9, we will discuss Stacks and Queues.</li>

								paragraphs of what you learned.
							</li>
							<li>Please submit everything in a ZIP file to OAKS.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
						<li>Please note that the "points" on Gradescope are labels and carry no numeric value. 
						The labels are Outstanding (4), Proficiency (3), Progress (2), Attempted (1), No Attempt (0). 
						Gradescope does not let me use letters instead of numbers. So in particular, if your Standard 1 Overall score is a 3, that is full credit and not 75%. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/3:</strong>
					For 9/4, please bring your computer. Class will be devoted to allow you time to work on HW2.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/1:</strong>
					For 9/2, please bring your computer. There will be in-class programming (ungraded).
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/28:</strong>
					As a clarification for HW1 and HW2, please do not use the java.util.ArrayList or java.util.LinkedList classes.
					The point of HW1 and HW2 is for you to implement these data structures from scratch, so that you understand how
					they work under the hood.
				</li>
				
				<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/26:</strong>
					For 8/28, please bring your computer. There will be in-class programming (ungraded).

					<li>Website created.</li>
					<li>The Syllabus Quiz is due 8/26 at 8 PM.</li>
					<li>HW1 is due on 9/2 at 8 PM.</li>
					
					
					<li>Please complete this optional <a href="https://forms.gle/zRKt1M1BnWtENLGQ7">Day One Survey</a>.</li>
					
					
					
					<li>Regarding LaTeX, I use <a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> as my compiler on my local machine. Many folks are partial to 
						<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, which is a free online service. Because Overleaf is a third-party service,
						it may go out at inopportune times (such as during a quiz or exam). For this reason, I am explicitly refraining from
						recommending Overleaf. You can use it at your own risk. There are many other LaTeX compilers-- you are welcome to use your favorite one.
